# employee-registration
- This application is totally focused on the backend. All the actions
were tested and run on the terminal.
- The idea was to create a CRUD application on the backend, validating
all the information and informing the user of any errors.
- Writing the code and inserting all the logic using Python from
beggining to end, helped me hone my programming skills.
